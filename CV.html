          <p>There’s one other type of skill section that you can list within your CV, and that is universal skills. This includes skills that are fit in the description or requirements of most career fields - such as MS office, teamwork, analytical thinking, and more.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Accountants also need great presentation skills.</h3>
          <p>Last, save it as a PDF unless the job offer says not to. A public accounting resume in Word format can devalue in transit. If it's hard to read, the hiring manager will award that juicy job to someone else.
            Pro Tip: Not a layouts whiz? Put a shout-out on Facebook for help with your accounts payable resume. You're probably one degree of separation from someone who can give expert design tips.</p>
